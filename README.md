# Real-time Human Detection & Counting !
[~ By Mayuresh Patil]()

In this python project, we are going to build the Human Detection and Counting System through Webcam or you can give your own video or images. This is an intermediate level deep learning project on computer vision, which will help you to master the concepts and make you an expert in the field of Data Science.

## Histogram of Oriented Gradient Descriptor
HOG is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. This is one of the most popular techniques for object detection, to our fortune, OpenCV has already been implemented in an efficient way to combine the HOG Descriptor algorithm with Support Vector Machine or SVM.



## Dependencies
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install imutils
pip install numpy
```
